Ephedra Ma Huang★Ephedra sinica★Ephedraceae★Ephedrine★Alkaloid [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875536418301237]★Ephedrine is an alkaloid that is an hydroxylated form of phenethylamineand sympathomimetic amine, with potential bronchodilatory and anti-hypotensive activities. Following administration, ephedrine activates post-synaptic noradrenergic receptors. Activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors in the vasculature induces vasoconstriction, and activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the lungs leads to bronchodilation. Ephedrine is an adrenergic receptor agonist used for its vasoconstrictive, positive chronotropic, and positive inotropic effects. Ephedrine and [phenylephrine] are still commonly used to treat hypotension but their use in other indications has decreased due to the development of more selective adrenergic agonists.

Pseudoephedrine displaces norepinephrine from storage vesicles in presynaptic neurones, thereby releasing norepinephrine into the neuronal synapses where it stimulates primarily alpha-adrenergic receptors. It also has weak direct agonist activity at alpha- and beta- adrenergic receptors. Receptor stimulation results in vasoconstriction and decreases nasal and sinus congestion.

Its seeds are used to make cocoa powder and chocolate. It is economically important as cocoa butter extracted from the seeds is widely used in the confectionery industry.  Used traditionally by the Maya and other indigenous groups as a ritual beverage, food and medicine. Physiological effects of consuming chocolate derived from the beans of Theobroma cocao include cardiovascular effects, regulation of blood pressure, insulin levels, glucose homeostasis, and lipid metabolism. The methylxanthines theobromine and caffeine are linked to positive changes in mood and alertness. The groups of polyphenols most abundant in chocolate are proanthocyanadins (58%), catechins (37%), anthocyanidins (4%). These flavonoids are associated with the glucose homeostasis and insulin level regulation, and they are present in small amounts in highly processed chocolates which also contain high quantities of sugar that would aggravate these conditions. Clovamide is a polyphenolic compound occuring in small amounts in chocolate which has shown neuroprotective effects.★t0, [GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe]★★10 to 12★[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6950163/]★(Akanegbu [10/28/2019]),  (Leibovitz 10/26/2020)]

It can grow forty feet in its preferred range, in temperate areas it will grow 8-10 feet in a growing season. Castor oil is a laxative that has been used for over 2,000 years. The oil is also an industrial lubricant. The seed coat contains the potent poison Ricin. Ricin is a protein toxin in castor beans which disables the ribosome of a cell. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4986263/] It has been used in assassinations, as there is no antidote. Castor oil is expressed from the beans also, but ricin is not present in castor oil. Ricinine is an alkaloid with central nervous system stimulant effects and insecticidal properties.★t3, [Ricin is one of the most potent naturally occuring toxins known. It is a rapid and irreversible cell toxin often used in warfare and assasination. Castor oil does not contain ricin and is safe in proper dosage as a laxative.  Overuse of castor oil can cause vomiting and dehydration, but is usually not serious.]★★9 to 11★★(Akanegbu [10/28/2019]),

It is the only clinically used drug to result from the screening program. The slow growing Pacific Yew could not provide enough bark sustainability. Taxol can be synthesized in 40 steps of reactions, it is now produced from a more economical partial synthesis from natural sources. Paclitaxol/taxol directly kills cancer cells while also regulating immune response. Cancer cells are killed through inhibiting mitosis or cause cell death due to chromosome missegregation on multipolar spindles. Taxol regulates immune cells including dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer (NK) cells, effector T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and macrophages. Taxol/paclitaxel is approved for the treatment of ovarian, breast, and lung cancer, and Kaposi's sarcoma by the Food and Drug Administration.★t3, [Taxol/paclitaxol is used in chemotherapy, side affects associated with its use include nausia, vomitting, diarrahea neurotoxicity.

Was brought to the American Colonies with the hope of starting a domestic silk production, the trees thrived, but the caterpillars did not. Moranoline from the root bark has been found to reduce glucose levels; fruit and leaves have also been used traditionally to treat diabetes mellitus. The proposed glucose lowering mechanism is by regenerating or maintaining the function of β-cells, which regulate insulin production and secretion. Arybenzofluron compounds, from inner bark have shown antimicrobial effects activity against methicillin–resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.★★★4 to 8★★(Leibovitz [4/14/21])
