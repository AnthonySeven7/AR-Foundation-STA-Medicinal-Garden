Ephedra Ma Huang★Ephedra sinica★Ephedraceae★Ephedrine★Alkaloid★Ephedrine is an alkaloid that is an hydroxylated form of phenethylamineand sympathomimetic amine, with potential bronchodilatory and anti-hypotensive activities. Following administration, ephedrine activates post-synaptic noradrenergic receptors. Activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors in the vasculature induces vasoconstriction, and activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the lungs leads to bronchodilation. Ephedrine is an adrenergic receptor agonist used for its vasoconstrictive, positive chronotropic, and positive inotropic effects. Ephedrine and [phenylephrine] are still commonly used to treat hypotension but their use in other indications has decreased due to the development of more selective adrenergic agonists.

It also has weak direct agonist activity at alpha- and beta- adrenergic receptors. Receptor stimulation results in vasoconstriction and decreases nasal and sinus congestion.

Agave★Agave americana L.★Asparagaceae★agavin (Fructan)★Sugars★Agavin are fructans, a highly branched form of fructose, the monosaccharide known as fruit sugars.  Agavin may function as a prebiotic in the body, supporting healthy gut flora and reducing some forms of mild inflamation in the digestive tract.★Hecogenin★steriodial sapogenins★Hecogenin is produced commercially from the extracted leaves of Agave sisaliana as a precursor for the manufacture of cortisone.★Agmeniside G★Saponins (spirostanol glycosides)★★Agave species are important commercial resources in Mexico where they are the basis for tequila, agave syrup, pulque, fiber, soap, precursors for industrial products and traditional medicine. The sap of agaves have been used as a binding agent for various powders for poultices on wounds. The unprocessed sap is taken internally in the treatment of diarrhoea, dysentery. The unprocessed sap is antiseptic, diaphoretic, diuretic and laxative. Parts of the plant can also be used for aching, treating syphilis, inflammation and snakebite. Agaves are at risk of overharvesting in their native range. Agave syrup has been widely promoted as a healthful sweetener due to its lower glycemic index. Agave syrup is 58% fructose. However diets that are high in sugar of any kind are a risk factor for diabetes and other morbidities. The processing of the fructans of agave syrup into fructose makes them an industrial product without the beneficial fiber and other constituents associated with its traditional use in Mexico. Hecogenin is retrieved from waste leaves from various Agave sp. when they are stripped for fiber, primarily A. sisal. A juice obtained from the leaves is fermented, then concentrated to 12% hecogenin content, which is used for the manufacture of cortisone. Agameniside G, aspirostanol tetraglycoside extracted from the fermented leaves of the A. americana, has shown anti-fungal activity against Candida albicans, C. glabrata, C. krusei, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus.★t0, [GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe]★Excess consumption can increase the levels of LDL cholesterol★8 to 10★https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128021897000113 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942216301261★(Akanegbu [10/28/2019]), Leibovitz 01/17/2022

Its seeds are used to make cocoa powder and chocolate. It is economically important as cocoa butter extracted from the seeds is widely used in the confectionery industry.

Physiological effects of consuming chocolate derived from the beans of Theobroma cocao include cardiovascular effects, regulation of blood pressure, insulin levels, glucose homeostasis, and lipid metabolism. The methylxanthines theobromine and caffeine are linked to positive changes in mood and alertness. The groups of polyphenols most abundant in chocolate are proanthocyanadins (58%), catechins (37%), anthocyanidins (4%). These flavonoids are associated with the glucose homeostasis and insulin level regulation, and they are present in small amounts in highly processed chocolates which also contain high quantities of sugar that would aggravate these conditions.

Castor Bean★Ricinus communis L.★Euphorbiaceae★Ricin★glycoprotein★Ricin is a protein toxin found in the seed of the castor bean at a ratio of about 1-5% of the bean.  The lethality of accidentally ingested beans is variable and mediated by various different factors, including whether the seed coat is intact as it passes through the digestive system.  Ricin has been featured in popular culture, including the show Breaking Bad.  One part of the molecule binds to the cell, while a second part prevents the cell from making proteins through inactivating ribosomes.  Rare but high profile cases of ricin posioning have contributed to its fears around its use a biological weapon, which in turn have lead to development of vaccine candidates, particularly for use by the military.  Potential therapuetic uses are in certain types of cancer, with the binding part of the protein molecule engineered to be selectively cytotoxic to cancer cells.★ricinine★alkaloid★Ricinine is an alkaloid biomarker that is used to asses whether someone has been exposed to castor beans or unpurified ricin as it is readily excereted in urine.★3-carboxy-4-methoxy-N-methyl-2-pyridone★pyridone alkaloid★A carboxcilic acid derivative of ricine, was found to be toxic to mosquito larvae★Ricinus communis, castor bean, is native to tropical east Africa.

It is a microtubule-stabilizing drug that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ovarian, breast, and lung cancer, as well as Kaposi's sarcoma. It is used off-label to treat gastroesophageal, endometrial, cervical, prostate, and head and neck cancers, in addition to sarcoma, lymphoma, and leukemia.

This endophytic fungii has been discovered in various plants, including Florida torreya (Torreya taxifolia), an endangered member of the Taxaceae family.  The endophyte (an organism that lives inside of a plant) is able to digest polyurethane in anaerobic conditions.★Taxol was discovered in the bark of the Pacific Yew in 1977 as part of the National Cancer Institute and USDA partnership in screening 15,000 plants for natural compounds with anticancer activity. It is the only clinically used drug to result from the screening program. The slow growing Pacific Yew could not provide enough bark sustainability. Taxol can be synthesized in 40 steps of reactions, it is now produced from a more economical partial synthesis from natural sources. Paclitaxol/taxol directly kills cancer cells while also regulating immune response. Cancer cells are killed through inhibiting mitosis or cause cell death due to chromosome missegregation on multipolar spindles. Taxol regulates immune cells including dendritic cells (DCs), natural killer (NK) cells, effector T cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and macrophages.
